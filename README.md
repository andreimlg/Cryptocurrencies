# Cryptocurrencies

We use unsupervised machine learning helps to discover patterns and when there is not known output. We are pitching to an investment firm what cryptocurrencies are worth investing. 


K-means algorithm is the path to know how many clusters are in the data. The K-means algorithm groups the data into K clusters, where belonging to a cluster is based on some similarity or distance measure to a centroid.

We could run the model by trial and error to get the number of clusters however we'll use elbow curve to do this. This consider the inertia as measuring the amount of variation in the dataset. When the curve has an important change in the inertia axes that will be the number of clusters we can use so there is not much variation in the dataset.

After using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is a statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of input features (or dimensions) is too high. We get this graph where we can perceive the different clusters and how they behave through the 3 Principal Components obtained.

Finally we plotted the relationship between Total Coins mined and Total Coins Supplied which is definitely one question will arrive at the final presentation.
